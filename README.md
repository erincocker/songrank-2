# SongRank 2

In this project, I'll create an application where users can input the URL of a Spotify playlist,
 repeatedly choose between pairs of songs from that playlist until they have effectively ranked the whole playlist, 
 and then automatically create the new, ranked version of the playlist on Spotify!

This is the sequel to my old python project [SongRank](https://github.com/erincocker/songrank)!

I initially wanted to simply recreate that in Java to test and exercise my more newfound Java skills,
 but that project ...leaves something to be desired.

Hence why in this project, 
 instead of ranking only a preset set of songs <small>(it was Taylor Swift's discography ðŸ¤ )</small>,
 users will instead be able to import any playlist from Spotify that they want to rank.

It's not the most useful application in the world, but I'm a fan of ranking the things I like,
 and through developing this, I hope to work on my testing (TDD using JUnit) skills, 
 and to combine my Java skills with my basic knowledge of the Spotify Web API.
